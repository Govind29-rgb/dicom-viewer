## 🏗️ Build for Production

To create an optimized production build:
npm run build

This will generate a `build` folder containing all the production files.

## 🌐 Deploying to Netlify

1. **Ensure a `_redirects` file exists in the `build` folder with:**
    ```
    /*    /index.html   200
    ```

2. **Deploy:**
    - **Option 1:** Drag and drop the `build` folder to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
    - **Option 2:** Use Netlify CLI:
        ```
        npm install -g netlify-cli
        netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
        ```
